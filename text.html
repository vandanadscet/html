    <h2>publication history</h2>

    <h3>premier</h3>
    <p>
        “The Premier Story is very much the history of the chronograph, as any book about Breitling must be,” writes author Fred Mandelbaum,
        Breitling’s foremost collector and brand historian, of the company that defined the look and function of the chronograph we know today.
         Breitling’s three generations of founders each played their part in shaping it. Leon Breitling patented the mechanism that would make his pocket chronographs manufacturable for the masses;
         his son, Gaston, introduced the first wrist-worn version with an independent pusher at two o’clock; 
        and his grandson, Willy, patented the second independent pusher at four.

    <h2>fictional character biography</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        The genre is rather a wide one. At one end there will be books that are essentially critical studies of a character, 
        or perhaps examples of "The Game", the scholarly-yet-creative research into the life and career of Sherlock Holmes. 
        While such books are biographical, it would be difficult to actually describe them as fully-fledged biographies.
         At the other end of the scale can be found novels that have simply been presented in an unusual way, 
        where the style of the biography largely gives way to narrative.
